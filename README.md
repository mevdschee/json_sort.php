# json_sort.php

Have you ever tried to write unit tests for JSON output? Did you run into the "unordered" nature of JSON 
in accordance with [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)? If so, this repo is for you!

It provides a single method that parsed and reproduces the JSON sorted in Lexicographical order.
It has no dependencies (other than json support in PHP) and is a single method. No path matching required.
